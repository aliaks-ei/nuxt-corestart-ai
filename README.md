### üì± Opening Your Terminal

Before we start, you'll need to open a terminal (command line) on your computer:

#### **macOS:**
- **Terminal app**: Press `Cmd + Space`, type "Terminal", press Enter
- **iTerm2**: If installed, same process but search for "iTerm"
- **VS Code**: Open VS Code, then `Terminal ‚Üí New Terminal`

#### **Windows:**
- **Command Prompt**: Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, press Enter
- **PowerShell**: Press `Win + X`, select "Windows PowerShell"
- **Git Bash**: If Git is installed, right-click in any folder ‚Üí "Git Bash Here"
- **WSL**: If using Windows Subsystem for Linux, search for "WSL" or "Ubuntu"

#### **Linux:**
- **Terminal**: Press `Ctrl + Alt + T`
- **Or**: Search for "Terminal" in your applications menu

#### **Basic Navigation Commands:**
```bash
# See where you are
pwd

# List files and folders
ls        # macOS/Linux
dir       # Windows

# Change directory
cd folder-name        # Go into a folder
cd ..                # Go up one level
cd ~                 # Go to home directory
```

### Step 1: Download the Project

You have several options to get the project on your computer:

#### **Option A: Clone with Git (Recommended)**

If you forked the repository (recommended):
```bash
# Replace 'your-username' with your actual GitHub username
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nuxt-corestart-ai.git
```

If you want to clone the original repository:
```bash
# HTTPS (works everywhere)
git clone https://github.com/original-username/nuxt-corestart-ai.git

# SSH (if you have SSH keys set up)
git clone git@github.com:original-username/nuxt-corestart-ai.git
```

#### **Option B: Download ZIP (No Git required)**

1. Click the green **"Code"** button on the GitHub repository page
2. Select **"Download ZIP"**
3. Extract the ZIP file to your desired location
4. Open terminal and navigate to the extracted folder

#### **Navigate to the project folder:**
```bash
cd nuxt-corestart-ai
```

### Step 2: Open in Your Code Editor

Open the project in your preferred code editor:

#### **Cursor (Recommended - AI-powered editor):**
```bash
# If Cursor is installed and in your PATH
cursor .

# Or open Cursor and use File ‚Üí Open Folder
```
> **‚ú® Special for Cursor users**: This project includes pre-configured AI coding rules and MCP integration for enhanced development experience!

#### **VS Code:**
```bash
# If VS Code is installed and in your PATH
code .

# Or open VS Code and use File ‚Üí Open Folder
```

#### **Other IDEs:**
- **WebStorm/IntelliJ**: File ‚Üí Open ‚Üí Select the project folder

- TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)
- ESLint
- Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
- Auto Rename Tag

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install all the required packages (this might take a few minutes):

```bash
# Using npm (recommended for beginners)
npm install
```

#### **Alternative Package Managers:**

You can use different package managers based on your needs:

```bash
# pnpm - Faster and more disk-efficient
pnpm install

# yarn - Good for monorepos and has excellent caching
yarn install

# bun - Fastest, newest package manager
bun install
```

**Why use alternatives?**
- **npm**: Default, most compatible, works everywhere
- **pnpm**: 2-3x faster, saves disk space by sharing packages between projects
- **yarn**: Excellent for large projects, reliable dependency resolution
- **bun**: Fastest installation and runtime, cutting-edge features

**Which should you choose?**
- **Beginners**: Stick with `npm`
- **Speed focused**: Try `pnpm` or `bun`
- **Large projects**: Consider `yarn`

### Step 4: Set Up Environment Variables

Environment variables are like secret configuration settings for your app.

#### Create your environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

---

## üîë **WHERE TO GET YOUR API KEYS** 

> **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: You need these API keys for the app to work properly!

Open the `.env` file in your text editor and replace the placeholder values:

```bash
# OpenAI Configuration
# üëâ Get this from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_openai_api_key_here

# Supabase Configuration  
# üëâ Get these from: https://supabase.com/dashboard (your project settings)
SUPABASE_URL=your_actual_supabase_url
SUPABASE_KEY=your_actual_SUPABASE_KEY
```

### üîë **Getting Your OpenAI API Key:**

1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Sign up for an account (you'll get some free credits!)
3. Navigate to **"API Keys"** in your dashboard
4. Click **"Create new secret key"**
5. **Copy the key** and paste it into your `.env` file
6. **Important**: Keep this key secret and never commit it to version control!

### üóÑÔ∏è **Getting Your Supabase Credentials:**

1. Go to [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
2. Sign up and **create a new project** (it's free!)
3. Wait for the project to be set up (takes ~2 minutes)
4. Go to **Project Settings ‚Üí API**
5. Copy the **"Project URL"** and **"Project API Key (anon public)"**
6. Paste them into your `.env` file

---

### Step 5: Configure Google Authentication (Optional)

To enable Google OAuth login, you need to set up Google credentials:

#### **In Google Cloud Console:**

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the **Google+ API**
4. Go to **"Credentials"** ‚Üí **"Create Credentials"** ‚Üí **"OAuth client ID"**
5. Choose **"Web application"**
6. Add authorized redirect URIs:
   ```
   https://your-project-ref.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
   http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
   ```
7. **Copy the Client ID** (you'll need this for Supabase)

#### **In Supabase Dashboard:**

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Authentication ‚Üí Providers**
3. Find **Google** and click **"Enable"**
4. Paste your **Google Client ID**
5. Add your **Google Client Secret**
6. **Save** the configuration

#### **Test Google Login:**
- Start your development server (`npm run dev`)
- Go to the login page
- You should see a "Continue with Google" button

### Step 6: Setup Cursor MCP Integration for Supabase (Optional)

*If you're using Cursor AI editor, this provides enhanced database integration and AI assistance:*

#### **Copy and Configure MCP File:**
```bash
# Copy the MCP configuration template
cp .cursor/mcp.json.example .cursor/mcp.json
```

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: You need to edit the actual `mcp.json` file, not the `mcp.json.example` file!

#### **Get Supabase Personal Access Token:**

1. Go to [Supabase Account Settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens)
2. Click **"Generate new token"**
3. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Cursor MCP Integration")
4. **Copy the token** immediately (you won't see it again!)

#### **Configure the MCP File:**

1. Open `.cursor/mcp.json` in your editor
2. Replace `<personal-access-token>` with your actual Supabase token
3. Replace `<project-ref>` with your Supabase project reference (found in your project URL)
4. **Save the file**

#### **Test MCP Integration in Cursor:**

1. **Restart Cursor** completely
2. Open the **Cursor Chat** (Cmd/Ctrl + L)
3. Try asking: *"Show me the database schema"* or *"What tables do I have in Supabase?"*
4. If working correctly, Cursor should be able to query your Supabase database structure

#### **Troubleshooting MCP:**
- **Not working?** Check that your token has the correct permissions
- **Connection errors?** Verify your project reference is correct
- **Still issues?** Restart Cursor and check the MCP logs in Cursor settings
