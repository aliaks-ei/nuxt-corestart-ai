```

### Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables

Environment variables are like secret configuration settings for your app.

#### Create your environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

#### Get your API keys and fill in the values:

Open the `.env` file in your text editor and replace the placeholder values:

```bash
# OpenAI Configuration
# 👉 Get this from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_openai_api_key_here

# Supabase Configuration  
# 👉 Get these from: https://supabase.com/dashboard (your project settings)
SUPABASE_URL=your_actual_supabase_url
SUPABASE_KEY=your_actual_SUPABASE_KEY
```

#### Where to get these values:

**🔑 OpenAI API Key:**
1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)

```bash
# Copy the MCP configuration file
cp .cursor/mcp.json.example .cursor/mcp.json
```
